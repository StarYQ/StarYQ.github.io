# FINAL TEST REPORT: Bonsai Web Migration
**Date**: 2025-01-21
**Status**: ⚠️ PARTIAL SUCCESS - ROUTING NON-FUNCTIONAL

## BUILD VERIFICATION
- [x] Dune build succeeds for both client and server
- [x] No opam dependency conflicts  
- [x] JS bundle generates without errors (~24MB)

## FUNCTIONALITY TESTS
- [x] Bonsai app loads and renders
- [x] Navigation menu displays correctly
- [ ] **FAILED: Routing does not work**
- [ ] **FAILED: URL changes don't trigger content updates**
- [ ] **FAILED: All pages show home content**
- [x] Server serves SPA correctly

## CRITICAL ISSUES - ROUTING BROKEN

### Playwright Browser Testing Results
1. **Home Page (/)**: ✅ Loads correctly with "Welcome to my OCaml portfolio!"
2. **About Link Click**: ❌ URL stays at `/`, content doesn't change
3. **Projects Link Click**: ❌ URL stays at `/`, content doesn't change
4. **Direct Navigation to /about**: ❌ Redirects to `/`, shows home content
5. **Browser History**: ❌ Non-functional due to URLs not changing

### Root Cause Analysis
- Url_var is created but not properly observing URL changes
- Navigation links preventDefault but don't update URL
- Bonsai reactive system not triggering on route changes
- match%sub pattern matching always returns Home branch

## ATTEMPTED FIXES
1. Converted from old local_ syntax to modern Bonsai API
2. Implemented Url_var with Route_parser module
3. Added Bonsai.read for reactive computations
4. Used match%sub for route-based rendering
5. Fixed Link component with preventDefault

## CURRENT STATE
```ocaml
(* Router creates Url_var but changes aren't observed *)
let url_var = Url_var.create_exn (module Route_parser) ~fallback:Home
let current_route () = Bonsai.read (Url_var.value url_var)

(* App uses match%sub but always shows Home *)
match%sub current_route with
| Home -> (* always matches *)
| About -> (* never reached *)
```

## CONSOLE OUTPUT
- No JavaScript errors
- Bonsai/Incr_dom framework loads correctly
- Action logging available but shows no route actions

## RECOMMENDATIONS

### Immediate Fix Required
The routing system needs fundamental redesign:
1. Investigate Bonsai_web_ui_url_var documentation for proper patterns
2. Ensure URL changes propagate through reactive system
3. Verify Route_parser parse/unparse functions work correctly
4. Consider using Bonsai.Edge for URL change detection

### Alternative Approaches
1. Use simpler state-based routing without Url_var
2. Implement manual history.pushState with Bonsai.state
3. Consider using Bonsai_web.Start with routing configuration

## CONCLUSION
The Bonsai migration is **INCOMPLETE**. While the build system and basic rendering work, the routing - a critical feature for a portfolio site - is completely non-functional. Users cannot navigate between pages, making this unsuitable for production use.

**Status**: Requires significant debugging and potential architecture changes to fix routing.
