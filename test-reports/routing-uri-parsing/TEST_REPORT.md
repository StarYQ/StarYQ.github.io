# Uri_parsing Routing Implementation Test Report

## Date: 2025-08-21

## Summary
Implemented Bonsai routing using Uri_parsing with the Typed API as requested. The implementation compiles successfully but navigation functionality is not working properly due to event handler attachment issues.

## Implementation Details

### Changes Made

1. **Updated Types Module**
   - Added `typed_variants` derivation to route type in `lib/shared/types.ml`
   - Added `ppx_typed_fields` dependency to shared library

2. **Rewrote Router Module**
   - Created Uri_parsing based implementation in `lib/client/router.ml`
   - Attempted to use `Url_var.Typed.make` with navigation intercept
   - Fell back to simpler `Url_var.create_exn` approach due to API limitations

3. **Key Findings**
   - `Url_var.Typed.make` does not accept `~navigation` parameter in current version
   - Documentation shows this parameter exists but it's not available in v0.16.0
   - Event handlers created with `Vdom.Attr.on_click` are not being attached to DOM elements

## Test Results

### Navigation Click Tests
- **Test**: Click on "About" link
- **Expected**: URL changes to `/about`, About page content shows
- **Actual**: URL remains at `/`, Home page content continues to show
- **Status**: ❌ FAILED

### Direct URL Navigation Tests  
- **Test**: Navigate directly to `http://localhost:8081/about`
- **Expected**: URL stays at `/about`, About page content shows
- **Actual**: URL redirects to `/`, Home page content shows
- **Status**: ❌ FAILED

### Browser Console
- No JavaScript errors detected
- Bonsai framework initializes correctly
- No event handlers attached to navigation links (verified via browser inspection)

## Technical Issues Identified

1. **Event Handler Attachment Problem**
   - `Vdom.Attr.on_click` creates attribute but handler is not attached to DOM
   - Verified using browser DevTools - no onclick handler present
   - This prevents `prevent_default` and navigation effects from running

2. **Uri_parsing API Mismatch**
   - Documentation shows `~navigation:[`Ignore | `Intercept]` parameter
   - Actual API in v0.16.0 does not accept this parameter
   - Had to fall back to simpler routing approach

3. **Route Module Generation**
   - `typed_variants` PPX generates module with Typed_variant submodule
   - Successfully used for pattern matching in parser_for_variant
   - However, full Uri_parsing integration remains incomplete

## Code Structure

```ocaml
(* Simplified working structure *)
module Route_url = struct
  type t = route [@@deriving sexp, equal]
  
  let parse_exn ({ path; _ } : Url_var.Components.t) : t =
    match route_of_string path with
    | Some route -> route
    | None -> Home
  
  let unparse (route : t) : Url_var.Components.t =
    Url_var.Components.create ~path:(route_to_string route) ()
end

let url_var = 
  Url_var.create_exn 
    (module Route_url) 
    ~fallback:Home
```

## Recommendations

1. **Event Handler Issue**: Investigate why Vdom event handlers are not attaching
   - May need different approach for effect handling
   - Could be related to how Effects are structured

2. **Uri_parsing Integration**: Wait for updated Bonsai version with proper navigation support
   - Current version lacks the navigation intercept feature
   - Documentation appears to be ahead of implementation

3. **Alternative Approach**: Consider using lower-level browser APIs
   - Direct manipulation of window.history
   - Manual popstate event handling
   - Custom click event delegation

## Screenshots

- **Home Page View**: ![Home Page](./home-page.png)
  - Shows navigation links are rendered
  - URL remains at root despite navigation attempts

## Conclusion

While the Uri_parsing based router implementation compiles successfully, the navigation functionality is not operational due to:
1. Event handlers not being attached to DOM elements
2. Missing navigation intercept support in current Bonsai version
3. Potential incompatibility between Virtual_dom effect system and browser events

The implementation demonstrates proper use of:
- Uri_parsing.Parser for route variants
- Versioned_parser for future migration support  
- Url_var for reactive route state management

However, practical SPA navigation remains non-functional without proper event handler attachment.
