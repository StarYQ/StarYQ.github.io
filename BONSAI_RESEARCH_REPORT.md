# Bonsai Web Components & Architecture Research Report

**Date**: January 21, 2025  
**Project**: OCaml Portfolio with Bonsai Web  
**Research Scope**: Comprehensive analysis of Bonsai ecosystem, component availability, and architectural patterns

## Executive Summary

After extensive research using multiple agents and context7 documentation analysis, we've discovered critical insights about our portfolio architecture:

### 🔍 Key Findings

1. **nav_link Component**: **Does NOT exist** in Bonsai v0.16.0 - this was a misconception
2. **Components ARE Available**: 20+ UI component libraries already installed with our Bonsai package
3. **Architecture Issues**: Our current routing implementation uses anti-patterns and needs fundamental changes
4. **Component Composition**: Found advanced patterns that significantly improve our architecture
5. **Immediate Opportunities**: Can enhance portfolio with forms, modals, tables, and advanced UI components

## The nav_link Investigation Results

### ❌ What We Thought vs ✅ Reality

**MYTH**: There's a nav_link component in bonsai_web_components  
**REALITY**: No nav_link component exists in any Bonsai v0.16.0 library

**MYTH**: We need to manually add components from GitHub  
**REALITY**: 20+ component libraries already available in our installation

**MYTH**: Our routing approach is fine  
**REALITY**: We're using anti-patterns that violate Bonsai's reactive principles

### 🔍 Deep Investigation Results

After exhaustive searches through:
- All Bonsai modules and submodules
- Virtual_dom library interfaces
- bonsai_web_ui_* components
- Jane Street GitHub repositories
- Community forums and discussions

**No nav_link component exists.** Our custom `Router.Link` implementation was the correct approach.

## Critical Architecture Issues Discovered

### 🚨 Anti-Patterns in Our Current Implementation

#### 1. **Polling for URL Changes (WRONG)**
```ocaml
(* ANTI-PATTERN: Our current approach *)
Bonsai.Clock.every (Time_ns.Span.of_ms 50.0) polling_effect
```

**Why This Is Wrong:**
- Violates Bonsai's reactive principles
- Wastes CPU cycles with unnecessary polling
- Not how URL variables should work in Bonsai

#### 2. **Global Mutable State (WRONG)**
```ocaml
(* ANTI-PATTERN: Global mutable reference *)
let route_setter_ref : (route -> unit Vdom.Effect.t) option ref = ref None
```

**Why This Is Wrong:**
- Breaks Bonsai's functional reactive model
- Makes state changes unpredictable
- Prevents proper incremental computation

#### 3. **Missing Lifecycle Management (INCOMPLETE)**
Our router doesn't use `Bonsai.Edge.lifecycle` for proper URL synchronization.

### ✅ Correct Patterns (From Documentation)

#### 1. **Reactive URL Management**
```ocaml
(* RIGHT: Reactive URL observation *)
let url_var = Url_var.create_exn (module Route_parser) ~fallback:Home in
let current_route = Bonsai.read (Url_var.value url_var)
```

#### 2. **Proper State Management**
```ocaml
(* RIGHT: Bonsai state with reactive updates *)
let%sub current_route, set_route = Bonsai.state (module Route) ~default_model:Home in
let%sub url_sync = Bonsai.Edge.on_change current_route ~callback:sync_with_browser
```

#### 3. **Component Composition**
```ocaml
(* RIGHT: Component returns (view, state) tuples for composition *)
let component ~config graph =
  let%sub state = create_state config graph in
  let%sub view = create_view state graph in
  let%arr view = view and state = state in
  view, state
```

---

## Advanced Component Composition Patterns

### 🔄 From TyOverby/composition-comparison Research

#### 1. **Parallel Composition Pattern**
```ocaml
let app graph =
  let first_view, first_state = Counter.component ~label:(return "first") graph in
  let second_view, second_state = Counter.component ~label:(return "second") graph in
  let%map first = first_view and second = second_view in
  N.div [ first; second ]
```

#### 2. **Sequential Composition Pattern**
```ocaml
let app graph = 
  let first_view, by = Counter.component ~label:(return "first") graph in
  let second_view, _ = Counter.component ~label:(return "second") ~by graph in
  let%map first = first_view and second = second_view in
  N.div [ first; second ]
```

#### 3. **Dynamic Composition Pattern**
```ocaml
let%sub others = Bonsai.assoc (module Int) map graph ~f:(fun key _data graph ->
  let view, _ = Counter.component ~label:(key >>| Int.to_string) graph in
  view
)
```

### 🎯 Key Insights for Our Architecture

1. **Component Return Pattern**: All reusable components should return `(view, state)` tuples
2. **State Composition**: Thread shared state through component parameters
3. **Dynamic Collections**: Use `Bonsai.assoc` for project lists, skill categories
4. **Configuration Parameters**: Use optional labeled parameters with defaults

## Community Insights from OCaml Forum

### 💬 Key Patterns from "How to Compose Janestreet/Bonsai components?" Thread

#### 1. **Focus on Values, Not Types**
- Components aren't strictly typed entities
- Focus on what they produce (`Value.t` and `Computation.t`)
- Use `let%sub` for instantiation, `let%arr` for transformation

#### 2. **State Flow Through Inject Functions**
```ocaml
let%sub navigation, nav_inject = Components.Navigation.create ~current_route in
let%sub content, content_inject = Components.Content.create ~route ~nav_inject in
```

#### 3. **Incremental Computation is Automatic**
- Bonsai provides automatic memoization
- Reference sharing for efficiency
- Only downstream computations recalculate when state changes

#### 4. **Anti-Patterns to Avoid**
- Don't hardcode values - use `Value.return`
- Don't bypass incremental computation
- Don't create overly rigid component interfaces
- Don't ignore state injection patterns

## Recommended Architecture Improvements

### 📋 Phase 1: Fix Core Routing (PRIORITY)

#### Replace Polling with Reactive URL Management
```ocaml
module Router = struct
  let create_router graph =
    let url_var = Url_var.create_exn (module Route_parser) ~fallback:Home in
    let current_route = Bonsai.read (Url_var.value url_var) in
    let set_route route =
      let url = Route_parser.unparse route in
      Url_var.set url_var url
    in
    current_route, set_route
end
```

#### Remove Global Mutable State
```ocaml
(* Replace global refs with proper Bonsai state *)
let%sub current_route, set_route = Router.create_router graph in
let%sub navigation = Navigation.create ~current_route ~set_route graph in
```

### 📋 Phase 2: Enhance Component Architecture

#### Implement Component Return Pattern
```ocaml
module Page = struct
  let component ~route graph =
    let%sub content = create_content route graph in
    let%sub state = create_page_state route graph in
    let%arr content = content and state = state in
    content, state  (* Return (view, state) tuple *)
end
```

#### Add State Injection Patterns
```ocaml
let%sub theme_state = Theme.create_state () in
let%sub navigation = Navigation.create ~theme_state graph in
let%sub content = Content.create ~theme_state ~route graph in
```

### 📋 Phase 3: Integrate UI Component Libraries

#### Contact Form Enhancement
```ocaml
(* Use professional form components *)
let%sub contact_form = 
  let open Bonsai_web_ui_form.Elements in
  let%sub name_field = Textbox.string ~placeholder:"Your Name" graph in
  let%sub email_field = Email.string ~placeholder:"your@email.com" graph in
  let%sub message_field = Textarea.string ~placeholder:"Message" graph in
  (* Combine into complete form with validation *)
```

#### Project Showcase Enhancement
```ocaml
(* Use accordion for expandable project details *)
let%sub project_accordion = 
  Bonsai_web_ui_accordion.create 
    ~items:projects
    ~render_header:(fun project -> project.title)
    ~render_content:(fun project -> project.description)
    graph
```

### 📋 Phase 4: Advanced Features

#### Dynamic Content with Bonsai.assoc
```ocaml
let%sub filtered_projects = 
  Bonsai.assoc (module String) projects_map graph ~f:(fun project_id project_data graph ->
    Project_card.component ~id:project_id ~data:project_data graph
  )
```

#### Theme System Integration
```ocaml
let%sub theme_provider = Theme.create_provider ~default:`Light graph in
let%sub app_content = App.create ~theme_provider graph in
```
